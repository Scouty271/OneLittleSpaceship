Hello and welcome to my little Space Shooter Android Handy Game!
This game came about from a personal challenge. A good game in 8 hours, and I'm proud of what it has become :D

You have great precision and enjoy beating your high score over and over again? Then you’re in the right place! In this game, you control a spaceship navigating through the vastness of space, dodging a ton of asteroids along the way.

Use your fingers to quickly and precisely tap the screen, destroying asteroids and battling through increasingly challenging levels. The further you go, the tougher the levels get – faster, bigger, and more dangerous.
But don’t worry, you’re not alone: golden asteroids bring money that you can use to buy better ships and rockets.

The controls are simple: just tap the screen to move your ship and fire rockets. But the real fun starts when you push your reaction speed and precision to the limit to beat your high score. Collect points and improve your skills to get further and further!

Ready to dive into an intergalactic battle and become the best? Your adventure starts now – have fun playing, and may the best pilot win!
